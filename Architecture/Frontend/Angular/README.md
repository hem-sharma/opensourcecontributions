This repository houses technologies integrations to serve best practices for a technology or trend.

* For this I'm considering AngularJS as a front end technology and related components will be listed here...

* There are some pre-requisites to start with Angular on machine considering a Windows machine to do the development, I'm using Visual Studio Code as an editor but you are welcome to chose your favorite one. For Mac or other platform set-up.

1. Basic undestanding of HTML, Javascript,
2. NodeJS (Install from <https://nodejs.org>),
3. Install angular cli after installing nodejs using this command (npm install -g @angular/cli),
4. Working knowledge of Git for source code (available at <https://git-scm.com>)

* Supports MVC,
* Easy for testing,
* 2-way data-binding,
* Expressions within HTML.
